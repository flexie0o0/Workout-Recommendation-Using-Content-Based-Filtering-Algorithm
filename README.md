# Workout-Recommendation-Using-Content-Based-Filtering-Algorithm
<h2>This project is made using Python, Streamlit and Python Notebook. The workout videos are recommended using Content Based Filtering Algorithm. The user can select any title within the given dataset and the workouts will be recommended according to it.</h2>

<h3>The steps to implement the Content Based Filtering Algorithm are:</h3>
1. Create a table under a database to store all the values of the required entities, such as 'title', 'description, 'video_path', etc.
2. Host the videos on any cloud or store it in your local drive. Set the path of the videos or any other files accordingly.
3. Export .CSV file from the required table.
4. Use any python notebook in order to implement the algorithm (Eg: Kaggle, Jupyter).
5. Make sure to have the .CSV file on the same directory as your notebook in order to read the .CSV file through the notebook.
6. Implement the Algorithm as shown in 'recommender-system.ipnyb'.
7. Export the .pkl files using 'pickle.dump.'

<h3>Creatiing the user interface using Python and Streamlit:</h3>
1. Create a sjango project.
2. Create a virtual environment (say: new_venv).
3. Create a python file 'workout.py'.
4. Import all the necessary libraries like streamlit, etc.
5, Install the necessary libraries (Eg: pip install streamlit).
6. Import the .CSV file and .pkl file. Make sure to keep it in the same directory within the 'workout.py'.
7. Activate the virtual environment (new_venv\Scripts\Activate).
8. Run the python file (streamlit run workout.py).

<h2>The project should run now.</h2>
